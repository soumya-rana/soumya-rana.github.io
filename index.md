# Hello, I'm Soumya ! ðŸ‘‹

![My Photo](/soumya.jpg)

I work as an analog circuit design engineer at Analog Devices India. I like quite a few things - circuits, 
    mathematics, programming (not that I am an expert in all, but I manage my income and quite some enjoyment out of these).
    You may find some hobby projects of mine listed in the "Projects" tab. They would give you some idea on design approaches for building basic analog circuits. 
    If you need guidance on GATE exam preparation, how to choose a career as an EE/EC student, how to build a career as a fresher in analog circuits, 
    or some help in an analog design hobby project, please feel free to schedule a meeting with me.
Connect with me on [LinkedIn](#), [GitHub](#), [Twitter](#)!
