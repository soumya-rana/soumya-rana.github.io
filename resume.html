  <h2>ðŸ“„ My Resume</h2>
    <p>This is not a formal resume meant for a recruiter or a particular role. Its more of what all I have done so far; 
        I may not be very well-versed some things that I have done in past, given that they are very different from what I do now.

    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I am a circuit design engineer with ~2 years of experience having mature proficiency on OTAs, Bandgap references, low speed comparators and
        intermediate proficiency on high speed clock distribution circuits. 
        Started my career in a multiphase buck converter product line, currently working on high speed circuits that go into cutting-edge 
        RF transceivers. I have a knack of programming as well (used to do leetcode in the past in my free time), so I try to explore avenues
        of using that knowledge to streamline my workflow.

      <span>IEEE INFOCOMM CNERT, May 2024</span>
      <p> The work involves design and implementations of two edge intelligence algorithms hosted at P4
        programmable end switches placed 400 km apart. These algorithms locally compute and command corrective signals to serve
        tactile internet applications such as remote surgery with â‰¤ 100Âµs RTT. Tremor suppression algorithm at the edge switch
        placed near the operator reduces bandwidth utilization by 99.9% by dropping packets without useful information. Pose
        correction algorithm at the other end corrects tool position of an Industrial Robot smartly without operator involvement.

      <span>IEEE LANMAN, July 2023</span>
      <p> The work involves implementation of IEEE 802.1CB standard (Frame Replication and Elimination for
        reliability) on programmable switches using P4 and Micro-C. The algorithms are meant to perform de-duplication in pipelined
        switches at 2.5 Gbits/s and achieved a worst-case processing time of 250 ns per packet. The paper lists the packet
        de-duplication algorithms implemented and presents the corresponding test results on a 2 host - 2 switch testbed.<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10189416" target="_blank">[Read More]</a></p>
