  <div class="resume-section">
    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I am a passionate software engineer with a strong focus on building scalable and user-friendly web applications. I love collaborating, learning new technologies, and solving complex problems!</p>
  </div>

  <div class="resume-section">
    <h3>Skills</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Programming: Python, JavaScript, C++</li>
      <li>Web Development: HTML5, CSS3, React.js, Node.js</li>

    <h3>Experience</h3>
    <div class="resume-item">
      <h4>Engineer, Analog Design Engineering</h4>
      <h5>Analog Devices, Bangalore</h5>
      <span>Jan 2022 â€“ Present</span>
      <p>
        <li> Designed and integrated a programmable clock divider (input frequency 2 - 16 GHz, division ratio 2 - 16) to reduce power consumption by 80\% and mitigate BTI aging in a $8\times33 $G DDR SerDes. Performed verification of full clock path (transmission lines, AC coupled clock buffers) duty cycle degradation and jitter from PLL output till Serialiser lanes. </li>
        <li>  Designed and verified the transmission line and clock buffers for the reference clock of the above PLL.</li>
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="resume-item">
      <h4>Analog Design Engineer</h4>
      <h5>Texas Instruments, Bangalore</h5>
      <span>May 2021 â€“ Aug 2021</span>
      <p>
        <li>Designed active snubber circuits to protect high side power FET in 12 V, 50 A buck converters during hard switching, with current
        switching rates above 20 A/ns. Performed post-layout design optimizations to ensure an optimal tradeoff between efficiency and
        SOA margins.</li>
        <li>Designed high side overcurrent comparator capable of operating at 12 V input common mode and 2 V peak-peak noise for high
        side overcurrent protection with post-layout delay of 25 ns, 
        ensured that PVT variation of the above comparator threshold is less than 5%.</li>
        <li>Co-worked with DV teams for bug fixes in top level functional and test-mode verifications of owned blocks and
        related sub-blocks to accelerate tapeout signoff.</li>
        <li>Obtained working knowledge of Voltus based EMIR flow and top level asserts signoff.</li>
        <li>Performed 2 silicon debugs of an existing device (1 production stop grade, 1 spotted internally) - 
        co-worked with validation team to devise experiments for hypothesis development and root cause understanding .</li>
