  <h3>üìù Instructions:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>I can give you career advice and guidance, not make choices for you or create magic. My aim is to improve your awareness and enable you to take the decision on your own.</li>
    <li>For mock interview, please share your resume over email once your booking is confirmed and you receive the invite.</li>
    <li>For career guidance related discussion, please list down your queries and send over email before the meeting. </li>
    <li>For guidance on some analog circuit design project, please share the problem statement, circuit diagram and your problem beforehand; that would help both of us. In case the question is beyond my area of expertise, I will let you know and cancel the meeting. </li>
    <li>If the query can be sorted over a LinkedIn DM, the discussion can be completed there and the appointment would be cancelled.</li>
