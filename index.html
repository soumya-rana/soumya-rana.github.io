  <h1>Hello, I'm Soumya</h1>
  <p>I work as an analog circuit design engineer at Analog Devices India. I like quite a few things - circuits, 
    mathematics, programming (not that I am an expert in all, but I manage my income and quite some enjoyment out of these).<br>
    You may find some hobby projects of mine listed in the "Projects" tab. They would give you some idea on design approaches for building basic analog circuits. <br>
    If you need guidance on how to choose a career as an EE/EC student, how to build a career as a fresher in analog circuits, 
    or some help in an analog design hobby project, please feel free to schedule a meeting with me.
